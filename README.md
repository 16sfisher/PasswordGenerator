# PasswordGenerator
[Link to Password Generator](https://16sfisher.github.io/PasswordGenerator/)
This is a random password generator. It will ask you which amount of characters you want the length of the password to be. For this assignment you can only use 4 to 128 characters. It also gives you the options to choose to include (or not include) uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and some symbols. A checkbox will indicate whether or not they will be used. If checked, they will obviously be included.

The generate password button will create a sequence of characters picked from the options the user has selected to use.

The 'C' button will copy the generated password to the computers clipboard.
